Platform version with Xamarin: Says on which platforms the app has a Xamarin version. If no other platforms are mentioned, it doesn't necessarily means the app has no Xamarin version on other platforms, but it hasn't been checked yet and you're happy to contribute with checking it.

Platform version with Xamarin Forms: On which platforms the app has a Xamarin Forms version. If no other platforms are mentioned, it doesn't necessarily means the app has no Xamarin Forms version on other platforms, but it hasn't been checked yet and you're happy to contribute with checking it.
